A geographic information system (GIS) has traditionally been used as a way for
organizations to create, manage and analyze  spatially referenced data in
<i>highly structured</i> ways. Many planners, however, avoid GIS  because the
way they analyze data (or the way they perceive their analytic techniques) is
not accommodated by the standard GIS toolkit.<p>
This paper focuses on the needs of urban designers, and argues that what urban
design is about--understanding the urban realm by finding patterns in the
landscape--is theoretically well suited to the adoption of GIS  technology.
Therefore, the problem is to create tools that serve this aspect of the
planning  profession. Two main areas emerge as critical. One is creating a
toolkit of standard sketch planning functions that takes advantage of the
ability of GIS to integrate numerous and disparate data sources. The other
involves building into the system a level of customization demanded by the
creative professionals engaged in urban design.<p>
To explore this topic, we begin with a review of analytic techniques espoused
by urban designers and architects as well as the latest research in using
information technologies to clarify complex spatial environments and
relationships. With this information in mind, two urban design applications are
prototyped. One is a prototype pattern finding application. The goal of this
application is to allow the designer to combine their knowledge of the area
with the analytic power of GIS to discover hard to find patterns in the city.
The second prototype tests the ability of GIS to answer questions that are
important to urban designers by applying the techniques Kevin Lynch espoused in
<i>The Image of the City</i> (1960) to the City of Boston, Massachusetts. In
particular, we try to find nodes (concentrations of activity) using only
digital data.<p>
Finally, the paper looks at how this research could be used in an actual urban
design project--the redevelopment of Mission Main, a public housing project in
Boston.<p>
