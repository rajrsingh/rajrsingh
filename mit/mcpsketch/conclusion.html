<h3>V. Conclusions</h3>
<h4>Sketch planning like Lynch with GIS</h4>
It has been shown here that the data sources currently available for a major
metropolitan area can be used to perform studies of interest to urban
designers. Using one designer, Kevin Lynch, as a test case, a GIS was modified
so that its basic functionality could be applied to modeling the spatial
concepts Lynch presented in <i>The Image of the City</i>. Although every one of
Lynch's concepts was not fully prototyped, the work progressed far enough to
prove that this area of research holds great promise. <p>
It was shown how Lynch's nodes, paths, districts, edges and landmarks could
begin to be identified using structural clues and GIS, but the most important
idea Lynch put forth in his work is that the people who live and work in a
place have the best answers to many design questions. This part of his theory
has been the most neglected by planners--Lynch says that his model was used as
a way of further distancing people from the design process instead of making
them a part of it. We have another chance to test his theory using new
information sharing technologies that can integrate the designer, the design
process and the citizenry. What is needed is an information system that can
gather information from people on issues of concern to the design process,
synthesize this input into some kind of shared understanding of the city and
report back the results and allow for comments on these results (like the
design process, the information sharing process should be iterative).<p>
The premise of this paper was that if design concepts could be integrated into
a GIS two benefits emerge. First of all, the designer can analyze a larger
portion of the landscape because once their methods are operationalized and
integrated into the GIS, computing power allows a relatively quick processing
of as much of the landscape as exists in the database. This benefit was seen in
the nodes prototype, where a GIS function for finding concentrations of
activity was developed based on familiarity with a small area of a city and
then applied to the rest of the city database. Second, having a computerized
information system will lead to new kinds of studies and working methods. The
pattern finding prototype suggests a new way for urban designers to take a
comprehensive look at how areas are similar and how they are different.<p>
Designers should add GIS to their arsenal of analysis tools. However, new
spatial analysis interfaces will be needed to attract this group of
professionals to GIS, because their modes of thought are often non-linear and
less rigidly structured than those who have already adopted GIS technology.
Although progress was made in creating a "sketch plan" of the city, detailed
data relating to the movement of people and vehicles would have been valuable
because it could have helped to explain how people move from home to node and
from node to node. It also could have helped answer some interesting questions
that were raised regarding how similar areas in the city relate to one another.
<p>
This study has shown, however, that GIS analysis can play an important role in
urban design. The pattern finding application stimulated a great deal of
exploration and discussion among the planners that tested it. The node finding
application proved to be a powerful tool, as it accurately located the busiest
areas in the city using only a detailed land use coverage and a well thought
out algorithm.

<h4>Creating an urban design GIS</h4>
This paper has looked at ways to improve the quality, speed and information
base of urban design using GIS. Of more concern to further research is
advancing past this point and looking at ways in which the basic design
<i>process </i>can be enhanced. In order to create information systems for
designers, three issues must be addressed: data access, user interface and
model development.<p>
Model development is concerned with the construction of, as Rowe puts it,
descriptive, explorative, predictive and planning models, as well as the
ability to go back and forth between design concepts/models and make
refinements. For example, in the nodes model, after developing the nodes and
using them in an analysis, I might want to go back and remove the constraint
that institutional uses be a requirement or make the node radius smaller. The
GIS must accommodate this kind of refinement easily. The construction of models
is also an important element of the system. The models presented here were
constructed with GIS scripting languages which are almost as complicated as
generic programming languages. A more visual-oriented model building system
would be necessary for designers.<p>
Interface issues fall into two categories, hardware and software. The standard
GIS interface currently consists of a keyboard and mouse for input (digitizing
tablets are usually used only for data entry), and a monitor for visual output.
It would be more natural for the monitor (visual interface) to rest on a table
and tilted only slightly to mimic the orientation of a map or reading table.
Regarding input, it would be best to use a stylus that wrote directly on the
screen because people are used to drawing on the place they want a mark to be,
not twelve inches away. These recommendations would not be made if their
purpose was only to make the computer interface more like one to which
designers are more accustomed. If there were significant advantages to be
gained from the current interface, then the designers should adjust--for
example, most people can type faster than they can write freehand, so perhaps
the keyboard should stay--but the current interface only exists because it was
easy to create, not because moving a mouse on a flat surface is better than
moving a finger across the screen.<p>
The software issue is concerned mainly with text-based input versus more
graphical methods. As software packages (and the hardware to run them) are
evolving, their interfaces are becoming more graphical and less text-based due
to user preferences, and urban designers share this preference. It was
mentioned above that scripting/model building should become more graphical, and
this is the main extension of the general argument that graphically-oriented
user interfaces are preferable to text-based ones. A less obvious software
issue is inter-application communication. Communications, word processing,
database, spreadsheet and GIS software should work together seamlessly in order
to promote maximum work efficiency. <p>
One glimpse at the way this might look in practice is the Netscape Navigator
software package with "helper" applications, "plug-ins" and the Java scripting
language. Navigator is a piece of software that provides Internet networking
capabilities. When the network software accesses text or graphics, it simply
shows the text and graphics to the user. When it accesses a kind of data that
it does not recognize, it uses a helper application, a plug-in, or Java to
process it. The idea is that the user simply tells Navigator what he or she
wants and lets that one piece of software figure out what other software might
be needed to complete the task. This may soon be the model for operating
systems and that would be a boon to the development and adoption of information
systems by all disciplines.

<h4>Integrating GIS into the institutional setting</h4>
The final issue to be addressed is data sharing. The technology described here
is impractical without institutional support at a variety of levels. First of
all, the urban planner needs a very detailed data set in order to analyze the
city properly. Data on Boston is approaching the level where it can be used in
this way, but many shortcomings were identified throughout this paper. More
importantly, data needs to be made more readily available to interested
parties. Local, state and federal governments must focus on increasing and
simplifying data access. Until a spatial data standard exists, data should be
made accessible in the native formats of all of the most common GIS packages to
minimize the costs of using GIS data--hard drive space is cheaper than
specialized labor and data conversion can be performed once instead of by each
user. <p>
As for private firms, their should be a change in policy regarding digital
data. Often when a government project is done by a private firm, the firm
retains the rights to the data, meaning the government can not distribute it.
This is a complicated issue to solve legally and financially, but it would be
in society's interest to create a system where all data created by public and
private entities could be accessed from a centralized place (so that everyone
knew where to find data). This system does not have to only contain spatial
data sets. Maps, reports and other sources of information can be in digital
form and be accessible through the network.<p>
Once these technical issues are resolved, a designer should have access to any
information for any place without leaving their office. This is not to say that
doing urban planning without leaving the office is a good thing, but rather to
emphasize that the overhead involved with the current system of identifying,
obtaining and converting data severely limits its use, and government can play
an important role in alleviating this problem.
