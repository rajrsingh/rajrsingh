<h3>III. Functional Prototype</h3>

<h4>Theoretical Scope</h4>
The functions offered here are novel only in the way they ask the user for
input and in the way that the computer delivers answers to the user. The focus
here is not to suggest new algorithms, but to define which algorithms are
useful for urban design and to adapt the traditional GIS interface so that
designers can make use of GIS for spatial data analysis.
<p>
<b>Figure 8: A Typical Thematic Map</b><br>

<p>
In all fields, GIS research should focus on exploiting the ability to
synthesize disparate data themes. The single variable thematic map is one of
the most common GIS outputs, but decision makers rarely want to know how
<i>one</i> variable varies across space. They want to know about the
interaction of many different variables. This type of analysis lies at the
heart of GIS, but the way software is currently configured, the user must be
familiar with a plethora of software-specific commands to perform an analysis,
which means that the help of a GIS specialist is usually required.<p>
An environmental sensitivity analysis is one example of this kind of study.
Data on vegetation, soil type, elevation, slope and aspect are synthesized to
come up with some measure of environmental sensitivity for every point in the
study area. Generally, scientists define the study parameters and then the GIS
work is performed by a technician who applies those parameters to a data set
and then generates a map.<p>
The need for better GIS interfaces is currently being addressed by individual
users who develop "modules" using the GIS package's scripting language (the
fact that all major GIS packages have a scripting language is an acknowledgment
of their weak user interface). Modules have been developed for forest
management, political redistricting, bus routing, etc. This section can be
thought of as an effort to build an urban design module. <p>
There are five components to the construction of this system. First, it must be
decided what are the important things to know about a city in order to
understand it (Kevin Lynch proposed that a city's edges, nodes, paths,
districts and landmarks must be known). Second, we must create computable
algorithms for the identification of these "important things"--Rowe's
descriptive model. Third, the user interface must strike a balance between
simplicity and flexibility. Right now, GIS user interfaces err on the flexible
side, allowing a multitude of operations if the user can figure out how to
perform them. A GIS for urban design should be easily employed by an urban
designer, so beyond the creation of functions with specific application to the
urban design field, an interface should be created which maximizes the ability
of the designer to explore the study area. <p>
Fourth, an urban design module must be flexible in terms of the definition of
algorithms. Urban design is different from most disciplines that use GIS in
that there are few generally accepted procedures that are implemented the same
way in every situation. Defining the "important things" that must be known
about a place is an issue that many people have an opinion about, but no
official body, like the American Planning Association, has set down any rules
or even guidelines on this question. For example, we may think that an
algorithm to find the shortest path from one place to another is an important
tool, but a designer may think that the time or distance between two places is
relatively unimportant to the design of an urban area when compared to issues
such as safety, a feeling of home, etc. "Although attempts have been made to
reduce design to completely explicit systems of search or synthesis, it remains
an art, a peculiar mix of rationality and irrationality. Design deals with
qualities, with complex connections, and also with ambiguities" (Lynch, 1981).
So an urban design module must allow the user to create their own analysis
tools, but in an easier way than simply providing a scripting language that is
closer to programming than using an existing program. This last aspect will not
be developed in the context of this work because of the extensive programming
required. Instead, this work develops the system the way Lynch might have, and
leaves the creation of a flexible interface to further research.<p>
Fifth and finally, an urban design or planning GIS must incorporate some method
of receiving input from the general public and organizing and synthesizing this
information graphically. The importance of including the public in the planning
process has been well documented,<a href="/rajsingh/www/mcpsketch/footnotes.html#fn9">[9]</a> but
decision makers often exclude the public from the process by arguing that it is
too expensive and time-consuming to hold numerous public meetings and try to
come to some sort of group consensus. Information networking technology offers
a forum for the public which could overcome these arguments. A general
framework for this part of the system would include the provision of
information to the public, a way for people to make comments with text and
pictures (possibly also video and audio), a way for people to browse the
comments of others and a way of synthesizing the input to get an idea of the
collective view on the issue.<p>
The scope of this work is to lay out all of the issues concerned with GIS and
urban design, but to only go into depth on a small number of them. This section
presents a prototype of the descriptive component of an urban design GIS. More
specifically, it looks at how patterns in the landscape could be explored, it
takes a detailed look at how to model Kevin Lynch-type nodes and discusses in
broader terms how the other elements of Lynch's legible city might be modeled.
<p>
<h4>The Database</h4>
The database used for this project consists mainly of basic information that is
usually readily available to city planners and consultants. Streets, parcels,
building footprints and aerial photography are crucial data sources for
municipal engineering and planning activities and are increasingly being
maintained in digital format. Many states have already implemented programs to
produce digital, high resolution, georeferenced aerial photographs of the
entire state, so this will increasingly be an inexpensive and rich data source
for local planning efforts. To complement these data that describe the physical
properties of the city, Decennial Census data is used to gain insight into the
demographic characteristics of the city. These data are made available by the
U.S. Census Bureau in digital form on CD-ROMs and on the Internet,<a href="/rajsingh/www/mcpsketch/footnotes.html#fn10">[10]</a> but even more significantly, many institutions have
begun offering preprocessed versions of the data,<a href="/rajsingh/www/mcpsketch/footnotes.html#fn11">[11]</a> making the data source much
easier to use by more people.<p>
A short description of the key data layers is presented here while detailed
source information can be found in <a href="/rajsingh/www/mcpsketch/appb.html">Appendix B: Data Dictionary.</a> The data layer
used to represent street areas here actually consists of the area comprised of
streets and sidewalks. No more detailed data set covering the entire city could
be found for these features. The building footprints data layer represents the
outlines of buildings as they would appear from an aerial view. No height
information was included and in many cases, multiple buildings are represented
as a single sha`e because of their proximity to one another. Parcels were
obtained from the City of Boston, who created this data set for tax assessment
purposes. Parcel-based data included land use, building value and land value.
Aerial photography came from MassGIS, the Massachusetts agency responsible for
compiling and disseminating state digital data. The photographs have a
half-meter resolution and are geographically referenced and orthorectified,
meaning that the picture has been adjusted to compensate for elevation and the
angle of the photograph. This is done so that the viewer seems to be looking
straight down on the scene and to maintain accurate sizes and shapes. Census
data was simply downloaded from the Internet using the U.S. Census Bureau's
service. All 1990 Census data is available in this way.<p>
These five databases--streets, parcels, building footprints, aerial photographs
and Census data--will be used in conjunction with local knowledge to generate
an "understanding" of the urban environment. This understanding will be
different depending on the needs and personal characteristics of each
individual planner. In this work I use Kevin Lynch's model of understanding the
urban environment as described in ]</a><i>Image of the City</i>. Although I use
this model as an example, the real strength of this application will be its
ability to be customized to process any designer's model of the city.
<p>
<h4>Pattern Finding</h4>
<pre>   Landscape abstraction should transcend traditional human understanding of the
physical world, and most importantly extend the limit of our perception of
reality.<p>
                                     Perron and Miller, 1991</pre><p>
I consider pattern finding to be a key aspect of any sketch planning GIS. Every
designer will want a slightly different set of tools, but the ability to
recognize and explore spatial patterns will be included in some way. This
function, in its simplest form, takes thematic data sets and allows the user to
combine them in various ways. For example, the user can quickly calculate and
view all places that are predominantly residential, urban, run down, with a
high rate of unemployment and comprised largely of non-native English speakers.
This is accomplished by combining demographic, land use and city assessor's
data. The utility of finding patterns is not the main focus here, but rather
the ability to quickly process pattern finding requests that bring together
multiple data sources.
Kp>
<h5>"Blind" pattern finding</h5>
One of the most important functions of this system is to be able to find
patterns and trends that a person might miss because the pattern is too subtle
or because it is based on the synthesis of many data sources. Thematic maps
only clearly show how one variable changes across space. In Figure 8 we can see
how unemployment clusters and disperses, but we don't see how it relates to
other spatial and social factors, such as roads, power lines, education, etc.
We could draw some of these elements on the map, but it would quickly become
too cluttered to be of any help in understanding the environment. The thematic
map's strength is breadth, while the site visit's strength is depth. A planner
visiting a site would quickly synthesize many types of information in their
head. The planner might be in a neighborhood with housing in poor repair, from
which he might assume that the properties were mainly owned by absentee
landlords. Seeing many working age people on the streets the planner might
infer that unemployment was high. Although a great amount of detail is gained
by being on site, the big picture is lost. This person can only have a very
general idea about the proximity of public transportation, the percentage of
non-English speakers, or the number of banks within walking distance.<p>
So then the goal here is to create a tool which offers the designer more depth.
The obvious way to accomplish this is to add multimedia elements to the GIS
such as pictures, video, etc., but the amount of time and effort required to
put develop that type of audio/visual database is too great. Instead, I try to
create a greater depth of knowledge by allowing the user to quickly find areas
that meet any number of conditions from any number of data layers.<p>
This is a task to which GIS is well suited because of its ability to overlay
spatially referenced data sets and contrast and compare their attributes. The
way this is often done in GIS analyses is to choose a number of data sets,
perform the overlay,  and then classify the resulting data set's values into a
thematic map. I did not want to use this method because it seems to presuppose
a knowledge of which data sets to overlay and what value will be important in
the end. Instead, I start with a place of interest. The user can find out
everything about the place (limited only by what data sets are available). Then
the user can find other similar places throughout the city. All of the
intricate overlay commands are transparent to the user, so that they can
concentrate on the exploration process. <p>
In order to combine these ideas into a prototype pattern finding application,
it was necessary to predict certain modes of operation for the hypothetical
user--two are presented here. The first assumes that the planner has in-depth
knowledge about one place--usually an street corner or a parcel, and wants to
find out the underlying characteristics about this place as well as other
places that have similar characteristics. The second is not based upon any one
place. The user is allowed to enter any characteristics of interest and see how
they compare.<p>
The place-based method is modeled by having the user select a building in the
area of interest. The program then allows the user to select any of the themes
present in the database that is of interest to the analyst. In Figure 9a the
user has selected population density. The next step is to decide what range of
population density is important. The value at the location of the building
(109.98) is given as a starting point, but the user decides that 100 is a
better minimum value. The maximum value is chosen in the same manner, and then
additional themes may also be added to the pattern. After all of the parameters
are entered, the program finds all areas in Boston that meet all of the
criteria.<p>
In this way, information about one place can be used to help the user find
other places that are likely to be similar without having to study every acre
of the city in detail. This proves to be a very stimulating method of analysis,
especially when places with similar characteristics turn out to look quite
different "on the ground."<p>
The non place-based method is similar to the place-based method, but the
conceptual goal is quite different in that the user's interest is not focused
on one specific place, but on a specific set of characteristics. The GIS aids
the user in choosing a range of values for each characteristic by reporting
certain statistics such as mean, maximum, minimum, standard deviation and
quantiles.<p>
<h5 align=center>* * *</h5><p>
These explorations become iterative when the designer takes the results of an
analysis (which the program allows to become another data layer) and refines or
expands that exploration path by further restricting the limits of a query or
adding another query element or intersecting two separate analysis paths. As
all the query results can be saved as spatial layers, they are all available
for use as inputs into subsequent analyses. For example, the result of an
analysis that finds areas that are sensitive to real-estate speculation might
be important in studies of economic development zones, road and utilities
upgrades, rent control, etc.
<p>
<h5>Inverse Analysis</h5>
This section focused on creating diagram-like representations of a complex
reality so that the urban landscape would be more easily understood. It would
also be useful to be able to start with a diagram and have the computer compare
that abstraction to a real place. This could be used as an evaluation test of
how well a plan was implemented, or a way to measure how much work it would
take to go from the present situation to the urban form suggested by the
diagram.<p>
Blind pattern finding can be a powerful exploratory tool, but the designer
often wants to start with a certain geographic boundary and understand what
makes the area within the boundary different from the area without. This is not
really pattern finding but pattern understanding, because what you want to know
is why the pattern that has been observed exists. The amount of programming
necessary to prototype this concept is beyond the scope of this work, but it is
important to keep in mind because it represents the beginnings of a predictive,
or planning model which would go beyond simply describing a place.<p>

<h4>Designing like Lynch</a></h4>
This section presents a prototype of how an urban design GIS might look for a
particular designer, Kevin Lynch. The pattern finding applications discussed
above are functions that most designers would consider a boon to sketch
planning. Here we look at a specific group of functions based on the ideas
Lynch presents in <i>The Image of the City</i>. The purpose is not to recommend
Lynch's theory over any other designer, but to show that design techniques that
currently are developed using the designer's "intuitive ability to organize
physical form" <a href="/rajsingh/www/mcpsketch/footnotes.html#fn12">[12]</a>
 can be implemented in a GIS where they can be informed by the data, knowledge
and experience accumulated by others. Some aspects of Lynch's model have been
developed more than others, but a great deal has been operationalized.
Sometimes the desired data does not exist (a notable omission is mentioned
under the section on Paths) and sometimes the algorithms needed are very
complex (see Nodes), but this prototype shows that there is no longer a
technological barrier to creating a GIS that would benefit urban design.<p>
Kevin Lynch, in <i>The Image of the City</i>, looks at the city as a place
where many aspects of physical form and land use are controlled by individuals
and not by centralized government, resulting in an environment which is
constantly changing over time. Within this framework, however, there is a
function for the city planner, and that function is to create an environment
where residents can take emotional ownership over a large part of the city.
Outside of this area that they think of as "theirs," there should be no
consternation associated with navigating around the rest of the urban
landscape. This vision of the city contains familiar, private home
neighborhoods, lively commercial and civic centers, and navigable and easily
identified paths between all of these districts. These building blocks of the
urban environment are called nodes, paths, districts, edges and landmarks.<p>
Lynch argues that understanding the city in this way will help planners be able
to plan cities that work better for their inhabitants, but in his 1985
reflection on the book's impact, he is disappointed with the way his work was
used. With his work in hand, planners felt that they could find these patterns
on their own, with no resident input, when Lynch's theory was that the location
of these nodes and boundaries of these districts must be ultimately defined by
the public. This is why a system of sharing experience (discussed at the end of
this section) is critical to the success of this model. While the physical
environment will offer clues to the image of the city, the computer can not
know how safe people feel on their street, or how many neighbors and
shopkeepers they can identify by face. This information must come from
individuals having input into the system, and this issue will continue to be
discussed throughout the paper.

<h4>Nodes</h4>
<pre>   Nodes are points, the strategic spots in a city into which an observer can
enter, and which are the intensive foci to an from which he is traveling. They
may be primarily junctions, places of a break in transportation, a crossing or
convergence of paths, moments of shift from one structure to another. Or the
nodes may be simply concentrations, which gain their importance from being the
condensation of some use or physical character, as a street-corner hangout or
an enclosed square. Some of these concentration nodes are the focus and epitome
of a district, over which their influence radiates and of which they stand as a
symbol.<p>
                              <i>The Image of the City</i>, pp. 47-48</pre><p>
So nodes are either notable intersections of paths or concentrations of
activity. In fact, these two definitions are self-reinforcing, as centers of
activity often develop at important intersections, and paths are often created
to service major nodes.<p>
In Boston's South End, the Boston Center for the Arts (BCA) intersection
(Figure 21B) is a neighborhood node. The BCA is a multi-purpose facility where
art classes and exhibitions are held and artists lofts and studios are located.
The block containing the BCA is on the north side of Tremont Street, with a
small theater next door and a music school and a parking lot behind. Across
from the BCA and along Tremont heading southwest are a number of small
businesses including coffee shops, restaurants and antique stores. The
Tremont/Berkeley Street intersection is a heavily traveled automotive path,
with commuters on their way to and from the  Massachusetts Turnpike and
Interstate 93. Pedestrians from the surrounding residential areas use Tremont
Street as a destination (for its cultural and commercial offerings) and as a
path to downtown Boston, located north and east of the node. Many children are
also seen in the area, as a number of schools are within a three block radius.
<p>
It is easy to picture a typical day in this node, with people hurrying to work
and school in the morning, adults grabbing coffee and breakfast along the way
and everyone avoiding the cars speeding along the streets towards the downtown
office buildings. Mid-day is quieter. Those who are fortunate enough not to
have to work visit the art exhibitions and stop in for a long lunch at a local
caf&eacute; and maybe browse the antique stores, hoping for a great find. The
afternoon brings a flurry of street activity as school lets out, and before you
know it dinner is being served at the restaurants. The area may remain lively
well into the evening if there is an art opening or a play that night.<p>
This knowledge is a result of many visits to the area over the course of a
three-month investigation of the neighborhood. The task here, however, is to
identify this node solely through the use of our database (local resident input
will be added to the system later). Earlier, nodes were defined as intersecting
paths and/or centers of activity. Every street is a path--although paths do not
have to be streets, but there are too many street intersections for this to be
an unqualified definition of a node. Each may be a node in a micro reading of a
site, but here we are concerned with neighborhood/city scale. Therefore, the
following conditions will lead to a more accurate attribution of the term node
for urban planning.<p>
A place may be a node if it is situated along a major street. Major may be
defined in an urban setting as a street of at least four car widths. This
translates at the minimum into one lane of traffic in each direction, with
parking on both sides. Sidewalk width is also important, as it influences
people's ability to interact with each other in this public setting  (sidewalk
data is unfortunately often neglected in the construction of an urban
database). <a href="/rajsingh/www/mcpsketch/footnotes.html#fn13%3E%5B13%5D%3C/a%3E%20The%20node%20is%20further%20strengthened%20by%20having%20a%20nearby%20intersection%0Awith%20another%20active%20street,%20Berkeley%20Street.%20Street%20activity%20may%20be%20difficult%0Ato%20define%20in%20a%20database%20because%20narrow%20streets%20like%20Berkeley%20Street%20can%20be%20very%0Aactive.%20Adding%20traffic%20count%20data%20to%20the%20street%20network%20would%20greatly%20enhance%0Aour%20ability%20to%20understand%20street%20dynamics%20with%20a%20GIS.%3Cp%3E%0ANodes%20are%20also%20defined%20as%20concentrations%20of%20activity.%20This%20concept%20can%20be%0Aapplied%20to%20a%20GIS%20by%20finding%20areas%20where%20multiple%20land%20uses%20come%20together.%0AEcologists%20have%20found%20that%20the%20areas%20of%20greatest%20diversity%20in%20animal%20and%20plant%0Aspecies%20occur%20where%20different%20land%20uses%20meet.%3Ca%20href="footnotes.html#fn14">[14]</a> Wetlands are so important because they are the transition
area between forests, fields and water. Being rich in food sources they also
attract animals from the land, air and water. The same theory can be applied to
the human species. Because of the varied needs of people, the greatest level of
activity will be found in areas that service the greatest number of needs. The
BCA is coded as commercial land use with institutional uses found to the west
and east. Residential areas surround these public uses, which is crucial
because public areas without nearby residential districts become ghost towns at
night and on weekends.<p>
One important characteristic of the area which is not reflected in the data is
that the buildings on Tremont Street generally have commercial uses on the
ground floor and apartments above (Figure 21A). The 1:25,000 land use database,
however, codes these buildings simply as residential. A mixed use
classification or a data structure which supported more than one classification
for a given location would be more appropriate here, as is supported by the
parcel-based land use data set. Agencies have resisted mixed use
classifications because if you have 20 classes and you allow for each to be
crossed with every other, there are 400 possible combinations. With 400
classes, the land use map is no longer significantly less complex than the real
world, so once again you may need a GIS specialist in order to make sense of
it. Agencies that create the database should be able to build in multiple
levels of detail into a database either with a different data model than
currently exists15 or with a different interface to the data than currently
exists.  The end user then has the freedom to choose the level of detail they
need to complete the task at hand. The parcel-based land use data set offers a
rich classification scheme (see Appendix B: Data Dictionary), but any
aggregation must be performed by the user.<p>
So this node can be generally defined as follows:<p><ul>
<li>it is on a major street<p>
<li>the sidewalks on the major street are wide<p>
<li>it is near the intersection of two busy streets<p>
<li>many land uses meet in this small area<p>
<li>residential areas are nearby<p>
<li>commercial and institutional uses are present<p>
</ul>

<h4>Finding nodes in the GIS</h4>
The above specifications serve to define a general idea of the kinds of
conditions that the GIS must identify. The next step is to create an
<i>operational </i>definition of node which will lead to the formulation of an
algorithm that will allow the designer to tell the computer, "find nodes!" The
form of this algorithm, as stressed throughout this paper, is something that is
unique to each user. Using the above specifications as a guide, a number of
algorithms are tested here in an attempt to simulate the <i>modus operandi</i>
of an urban planner. <p>
Starting from the assumption that the area around urban nodes must include
commercial, residential and institutional uses, I use an algorithm (Figure 11)
that searches the land use data set (Figure 12) in a 500-foot radius around
every cell for different land uses. If the aforementioned three land uses are
not present, then the point can not be a node. If they are present, the point
is ranked in comparison to other nodes based upon how many different types of
land use are present in the area. Next, since I am in the experimental stage
(i.e. not yet at the point where I have decided upon only one way to find
nodes), I perform the same analysis again using a 260 foot search radius
(Figure 16), and then once again using a 1,000 foot search radius. I see that
the 1,000 foot radius is to be to large because it searching an almost
half-mile diameter area, which is too large to be considered a single place in
this urban context, but the other two searches seem to hold promise. <p>
During the course of this research (as often happens in real life) a more
detailed source of land use data became available, so I am able to run the same
500-foot and 260-foot search radius analyses using parcel-based land use with
an intermediate classification (Figures 17 and 18) and with a highly detailed
classification scheme (Figures 19 and 20). The difference between the
intermediate and detailed classification schemes is not only the number of
categories, but also the purpose for which the categories were created. The
intermediate scheme was one that came with the database (Figure 13)--it could
have been geared towards tax assessment, utility maintenance, or something
else. The detailed scheme was developed specifically for this study (Figure
14). This can be seen in the category labels to the left of the maps.
<p>
<b>Figure 11: The Node finding algorithm</b><br>
<img src="/rajsingh/www/mcpsketch/nodeflow.gif"><p>
The process I used to evaluate the success rate of finding nodes at this
initial stage was to simply see if the found nodes coincided with Lynch's study
(Figure 4) and my knowledge of downtown Boston.<a href="/rajsingh/www/mcpsketch/footnotes.html#fn16">[16]</a> The area of the city most Bostonians are familiar with
consists of the Fenway/Kenmore, Back Bay/Beacon Hill, South End, and Central
neighborhoods (Figure 23: City-defined Districts). There were three nodes here
that I used as benchmarks, Kenmore Square, The BCA corner and Newbury Street.<p>
Kenmore Square is a major city-wide node (Figure 21C). The roads coming
together here are eight lanes wide in some sections. The effect of this is
mitigated by a strip of useable area separating the two directions of traffic.
Most of this strip is used as a park, but near the actual intersection there is
a bus and subway station in this zone. The many diverse businesses include
restaurants, music stores, a funeral parlor, the Boston University Bookstore,
nightclubs, convenience stores, clothing stores and coffee shops. These are
supported by Boston University, apartments and hotels, the baseball park, and a
nearby street that serves as "nightclub row."<p>
The BCA corner is a more subtle, neighborhood node. Only people who live or
work in the South End are likely to frequent this area. Exceptions are those
who are coming to the BCA for an event or in their car cutting through the
South End on their way to the highway. The nature of the stores reflect this.
They are mostly convenience stores, small restaurants and dry cleaners. Newbury
Street is another major node, but it is different in that it is linear. The
street is lined with shops that appeal to tourists and the wealthy, as well as
eating places for locals.<p>
The areas found with the 1:25,000-scale land use and a 500-foot search radius
included the three test nodes mentioned above, but many other areas were also
found. These did appear to be more active than the areas that were not found,
but there was not enough of a distinction between places for the operation to
be useful. Also, although the test areas were found, they were ranked lower
than areas that are actually less active. Searching a 260-foot radius reduced
the amount of area selected, but did not help in better identifying actual
nodes. Similar problems resulted from the analysis using parcel-based land use
and the intermediate classification scheme. Too much of the city was identified
as "node-like" and the ranking of areas did not correspond well to the actual
distribution of activity. This is a result of the classification scheme having
little relation to urban design issues (Figure 13). The only category that was
not residential, commercial or institutional is industrial, and what this
categorization scheme emphasizes is the differing densities of residential
areas. Although it may seem obvious that this description of land use would not
be useful, I wanted to run the analysis with it to show how important the base
data and categorization is to obtaining useful information.<p>
The detailed classification scheme includes a number of important disaggregated
land use categories. Institutional use is separated into schools, hospitals,
library/museum/galleries, religious and other. Industrial use is separated into
light industry, manufacturing and utilities. Commercial use is separated into
retail, hotels, restaurants/bars and offices. These important differences in
land use allow the node finding function to create highly descriptive and
useful nodes (Figures 19 and 20), although this data set did not identify the
BCA node. The major difference between the 500-foot and 260-foot detailed land
use nodes is the size of the area identified. It seems that concentration of
activity is better represented by the 260-foot search radius, but the data is
not accurate enough (or the node finding function is not fine-tuned enough) for
this search to work as well as the 500-foot radius search. In other words, the
260-foot radius is closer to the actual size of a node, but we must find
larger, more general areas because even the parcel-based land use data set has
drawbacks. For example, the BCA node was not found in large part because the
land use data does not classify the buildings along Tremont Street. For some
reason these areas were left out of the data set.<p>
Once the algorithm was fine-tuned and studied in the lab as described above, I
was ready to investigate the nodes that had been found in  other parts of the
city. This two-step process of building theory and associated algorithms in the
office and then field-checking the theory reflects the general idea that the
GIS should allow the designer to apply their knowledge about a small area to
the entire city. I used my knowledge of downtown Boston to formulate an
algorithm that would identify areas I consider nodes and then the algorithm
applied that concept to the rest of the study area. In fact, the algorithm was
extremely successful in performing this task, although this success is
difficult to prove because design methods are inherently difficult to quantify.
A photographic presentation (Figure 21) of the nodes is the best way to
describe them without labor-intensive pedestrian and traffic counts or video.
All photographs were taken between 9:00AM and 5:00PM on weekdays.<p>

<h4>What this means to the designer</h4>
The nodes study shows that information regarding how people move about the city
can be obtained from seemingly static data. The data has been transformed from
a description of land uses with their associated areas and spatial
relationships to a story telling where people frequent and how busy certain
places are in comparison to others. Operational analyses of the concepts of
district, path, edge and landmark are not developed fully here but the basic
theory is the same. The digital data sets that are currently being developed
hold a wealth of information for urban designers--the functionality needed to
transform raw data into objects useful to designers, like nodes, just has not
yet been invented.<p>
The difficulty in creating the node finding algorithm had more to do with data
and computing resources than with conceptual issues. Without the parcel-based
land use data set, this study would not have been successful. This is
significant because very few cities have developed digital data sets at this
level of detail, but detail is crucial to studies of the urban environment.
Computing power is also an issue. This analysis would not have been possible
with the kind of computing power currently available in personal computers.
UNIX workstations were used, and even then it was only feasible to analyze a
portion of the city, which itself is only a portion of the metropolitan area.
Progress in the detail of data sets and computational power will make
experimentation in this area much more practical in the future.<p>

<h4>District</h4>
<pre>   Districts are medium-to-large sections of the city, conceived of as having
two-dimensional extent, which the observer mentally enters "inside of," and
which are recognizable as having some common, identifying character. Always
identifiable from the inside, they are also used for exterior reference if
visible from the outside. Most people structure their city to some extent in
this way, with individual differences as to whether paths or districts are the
dominant elements. It seems to depend not only upon the individual, but also
upon the given city.<p>
                                   <i>The Image of the City</i>, p. 47</pre><p>
The easiest way to explain the concept of district is by example. In Boston,
the South End, the North End, Back Bay and the Financial District are obvious
districts. New York has Greenwich Village, Soho, Wall Street, Harlem and
countless others. Although specific boundaries may be hard to agree upon, the
general existence and location of most districts are easy for residents to
acknowledge.<p>
A useful distinction can be made here between a neighborhood district and a
physical district. Defining neighborhood districts using digital data is
difficult because the boundaries may be based on historical events, informal
gang (south-central Los Angeles) or politician-controlled areas, elevation
(Beacon Hill, Boston), etc. Some of these factors have some physical form and
can therefore be captured in a GIS, but some will not. Furthermore, physical
form may lead the designer into misclassifying a neighborhood. For example,
Boston's South End crosses over Massachusetts Avenue, a street so wide that
planner unfamiliar with the area would assume that no neighborhood could cross
that barrier.<p>
The issue of defining districts for Boston was aided by the fact that one of
the data sets available specifically addresses this issue by outlining and
naming the eighteen neighborhoods of the city (Figure 23: City-defined
districts). An interesting use of the inverse pattern finding application
described at the end of this paper would be to take one of these neighborhoods
and ask what is different about it as compared to the rest of the city, or
adjacent neighborhoods. In this way the accuracy and usefulness of the
neighborhood data set could be evaluated. Districts are an important
macro-level concept of neighborhood, but micro-districts are also crucial to a
sense of comfort in the city. These districts would be a number of blocks,
rather than a section of the city. This is the area in which many of the faces
should be familiar. Christopher Alexander describes this as <i>Pattern 14:
Identifiable Neighborhood</i>, which says, "People need an identifiable spatial
unit to belong to." 17  The district as Lynch defines it would be a closer
match to <i>Pattern 12: Community of 7000</i>, which states, "Individuals have
no effective voice in any community of more than 5000=10,000 persons."<a
href="/rajsingh/www/mcpsketch/footnotes.html#fn18">[18]</a><p>
Alexander's definition of community is reflected in the dividing up of Boston
into wards, the smallest political unit in the city. Neighborhood boundaries
can be explored using traditional thematic mapping techniques. The three
districts generated in Figure 23 are shaded by taking the minimum and maximum
values for the attribute in question (median family income, percent Asian and
percent Black) and dividing that range into four equal ranges. The Back
Bay/Beacon Hill area is home to the only city residents whose average income is
more than the city's average of $35,532 (Figure 23: A high income district).
Boston's Chinatown district appears clearly by classifying the city by
percentage Asian population. Only the small Chinatown area has a greater than
50% Asian population in each block group (Figure 23: An Asian district).
Similarly, Blacks seem to be concentrated in Roxbury and Mattapan.<p>

<h4>Path</h4>
<pre>   Paths are the channels along which the observer customarily, occasionally, or
potentially moves. They may be streets, walkways, transit lines, canals,
railroads. For many people, these are the predominant elements in their image.
People observe the city while moving through it, and along these paths the
other environmental elements are arranged and related.<p>
                                     <i>The Image of the City</i>, p. 47</pre><p>
Roads and transit lines are easily included in a GIS, the difficulty comes in
classifying them according to use. Road width is one way to obtain a rough idea
of how heavily used a street is for vehicular traffic, but this is only one
type of path. Jacobs suggests that the number of intersections one street has
with others is a good indicator of how busy and interesting a street will be
because more intersections implies a greater potential to be part of the route
to more destinations.<a href="/rajsingh/www/mcpsketch/footnotes.html#fn19">[19]</a> For example, one
would only find people who are going somewhere on that street on a long street
with no intersections.<p>
Since paths are channels along which people customarily move and nodes are
places at which people customarily meet, it is logical that people will
customarily move from node to node. This suggests a different method of
defining paths. Instead of going back to the original data sources to model the
path concept, it can be constructed from the nodes model. This theory works
particularly well for Newbury Street (along the northeastern portion of Figure
20). This street is used by many go from the western part of downtown Boston to
the financial district in the northeast. It is more frequently used than the
completely residential streets to its north because it offers the opportunity
to see more people, have a snack or window shop.<p>
Apart from being a connection of nodes, the classification of paths proved to
be the most difficult concept of Lynch's to model. Transportation data is
rarely very detailed, due to the time and expense associated with pedestrian
and traffic counts and classifying a street as a single unit when its name may
change along its route. Because of this lack of helpful data sources, this is
one area in which I do not foresee GIS being immediately helpful to urban design.<p>

<h4>Edge</h4>
<pre>   Edges are the linear elements not used or considered as paths by the observer.
They are the boundaries between two phases, linear breaks in continuity:
shores, railroads cuts, edges of development, walls.<p>
                                      <i>The Image of the City</i>, p. 47</pre><p>
The identification of hard edges may clearly be aided by GIS. Many times a
district will be constructed using one type of data (demographics) and the edge
will be formed by another (streets, rail lines, water features). The overlay
and intersection capabilities of GIS allow this type of analysis to be
performed in a straightforward manner. That addresses the question of hard
edges, but Lynch also identifies soft edges, which he calls seams. Soft edges
separate distinct regions but have no easily observable edge element. <p>
Soft edges can be roughly identified with GIS because edges must be defined in
the creation of any vector-based data set. For instance, the Census data used
was based on block groups. These are usually two to four city block areas that
U.S. Census Bureau researchers have decided are similar enough to aggregate
into a block group. The 1:25,000 land use data set also required a trained
professional to decide where one area ended and the next began. This was not a
problem with the parcel-based data because lot lines served as the edges.<p>

<h4>Landmark</h4>
<pre>   Landmarks are another type of point-reference [like nodes], but in this case
the observer does not enter within them, they are external. They are usually a
rather simply defined physical object: building, sign, store, or
mountain...They may be within the city or at such a distance that for all
practical purposes they symbolize a constant direction... They are frequently
used clues of identity and even of structure, and seem to be increasingly
relied upon as a journey becomes more and more familiar.<p>
                                        <i>The Image of the City</i>, p. 48</pre><p>
Finding landmarks would be one of the most difficult tasks for a traditional
GIS. As directional guides, they are often taller than other landscape
features, which makes them difficult to distinguish with data sets that rarely
include object heights. Many objects become landmarks because they stand out
from their surroundings in other ways, like appearance, and this characteristic
is also rarely captured in a database.<p>
The best way to identify landmarks is through resident input.  In fact, one of
Lynch's main points is that all of the preceding elements of the city should be
identified using the experience of the people that define them through their
daily activities.<p>

<h4>Information Sharing</h4>
The reader may have noticed that in the references to the text of <i>The Image
of the City</i>, Lynch usually defines the elements of the city in terms of an
observer. The point is that the designer can not understand an urban landscape
only through his or her own observation--it is an understanding of how
residents observe their city that counts. Urban design and planning differs
greatly from many other sciences in this way. Environmental scientists can not
ask herons whether they are comfortable with the current size of their habitat,
or whether the construction of a proposed road would keep them from using a
nearby wetland. The input of residents has long been considered crucial to the
formulation of good design plans, but decision makers rarely get this valuable
information because it is perceived to be too time-consuming to get the
opinions of a large number of people.<p>
Lynch put forth the effort to interview individuals, but each interview took at
least two hours, so his technique could not be considered an implementable
model in the context of a city government working within a limited budget.
Advances in networking technologies and electronic communication should make
the collection and analysis of public opinion on local issues more common, but
research on integrating GIS and public input is still in its infancy. <p>
Lynch asks four questions of his interviewees. Draw a sketch map of the area
showing interesting and important features, sketch the route and events along
an imaginary trip, list parts of the city felt to be most distinctive, and
describe where a few objects are located. Instead of sitting down with a person
and asking these questions, they can now be asked and answered with a computer.
As we may soon reach the point in America where  a large and diverse portion of
the citizenry could be reached through electronic networks, Lynch's technique
should be revisited with these new tools in mind.
