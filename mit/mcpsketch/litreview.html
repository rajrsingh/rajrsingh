<h3>II. Literature Review</h3>

<h4>Modeling and Design Thinking</h4>
The need for the design profession to embrace analytic methods of inquiry has
been observed since the 1960s when many people realized that the rate of
American urbanization was increasing exponentially, and our institutions were
not equipped to deal with the phenomenon. As civilization became more complex,
the ability for a single person to understand the full range of issues that
affect a given problem dwindled, yet our planning processes did not adapt to
this situation--they still depended largely on the belief that the mental
faculties of one person, or a small group of people, were sufficient to
synthesize all of the pertinent information regarding a problem. Many planning
disciples have begun to use computerized information systems to help cope with
modern urban processes, but the trend has not been observed in the design
profession. <p>
Christopher Alexander saw that, "unable to cope with the complicated
information [the urban designer] is supposed to organize, he hides his
incompetence in a frenzy of artistic individuality...In this atmosphere the
designer's greatest gift, his intuitive ability to organize physical form, is
being reduced to nothing by the size of the tasks in front of him, and mocked
by the efforts of the `artists.' What is worse, in an era that badly needs
designers with a synthetic grasp of the organization of the physical world, the
real work has to be done by less gifted engineers, because the designers hide
their gift in irresponsible pretension to genius."<a href="/rajsingh/www/mcpsketch/footnotes.html#fn2">[2]</a> The problem as stated here seems as relevant and novel as it
must have seemed then. This passage comes from <i>Notes on the Synthesis
of Form</i>, in which Alexander begins to formulate a theory on how designers
might begin to use formal logic to solve design problems. Very generally, the
theory involves finding the entire set of design problems that must be solved
or conditions to be met and determining which are related to each other and in
what order to solve them.<p>
Alexander was not the only one to espouse this approach. In <i>Design
Thinking</i> (Rowe, 1987), Peter Rowe states that in European design schools of
the 1950s and 1960s, "attempts were made to describe the creative
problem-solving process at work in design by way of the logical structure of
overt activities that appears to take place. In other words, design was
regarded as a series of stages characterized by dominant forms of activity,
such as analysis, synthesis, evaluation, and so on" (p. 46). Furthermore, these
theories usually incorporated an iterative property, to make explicit the
process of designing based upon the information at hand and then refining the
design by reevaluating the original set of information with respect to previous
design solutions. Asimow (1962), Archer (1963-1964) and later Steinitz (1995)
proposed variations on this "operational" model of the design process (Figure
2). Sch&ouml;n (1983) focuses less on the operational aspect of the model and
more on its iterative properties, as the designer continuously reflects on the
work.<p>
These approaches to design were an attempt to solve "ill-defined" design
problems. Rowe describes three types of problems, well-defined, ill-defined,
and wicked. Well-defined problems, like 2x + 5x2 = 29, have obvious starting
and ending points and rules to follow from beginning to end. Ill-defined
problems, which Rowe believes encompasses most architecture and urban design
problems, usually have desired goals, but the solution which will achieve the
goals is unclear as well as the initial conditions. Wicked problems are those
for which the goals, starting point and ending point are up for constant
debate, like hazardous waste disposal. There is no specific result that can be
agreed upon as the best possible solution to the problem.

<p>
Many of the ideas in <i>Design Thinking</i> are worthy of consideration, but
Rowe's discussion of operational models and modeling is the most relevant to
this work. He starts with Echenique's definition of models, "A model is simply
a representation of relevant characteristics of a reality...a means of
expressing certain characteristics of an object, or system, that exists,
existed, or might exist" (Echenique 1963, p. 1). He then groups models into
four categories: descriptive, predictive, explorative and planning. Descriptive
models seek to explain what and why something is the way it is and how it
works. Rowe would describe Lynch's city imageability concept as a descriptive
model. Predictive models are either extrapolative, in that they predict the
future based on what can be expected from looking at the past, or conditional,
in that changes in inputs result in different outputs. Explorative models are,
"designed to allow the discovery, by systematic speculation, of realities other
than the one at hand that may be logically possible. Such speculation usually
proceeds by exploiting the systematic variation of basic parameters used in a
descriptive model" (p. 167). <p>
<b>Figure 3: A Hierarchy of Model Types (Rowe 1987)<br>
<img src=/rajsingh/www/mcpsketch/rowemodels.gif><p>
</b>
The planning model as Rowe defines it builds upon the other three types.
In his planning model, descriptive models are required to understand the
current state of affairs. Next, different interventions can be evaluated with a
predictive model to generate possible solutions. The solutions are then ranked
objectively according to their ability to meet stated goals. Explorative models
may be used to generate predictive models, ranking schemes, or other decision
support tools.<p>

I have avoided allowing the applications developed here to fall into the
realm of predictive or planning models because they are intended to be more
pure. Those two kinds of models inherently require value judgments that must be
made separately as each planning problem is faced. These applications
intentionally try only to be descriptive (in the case of the node-finding
algorithm) or explorative (the pattern-finding application). Too often the
tendency is to create an application that makes decisions, as in Rowe's
planning model. This is difficult, and not necessarily wise, as examples from
the environmental field show us.  

<h4>The environmental field</h4>
Most of the recent environmental modeling literature is geared towards
resolving some issue as opposed to simply investigating the "relevant
characteristics of an object or process." <i>Landscape Ecology and GIS</i>
(Haines-Young et al 1993) and <i>Environmental Modeling and GIS</i> (Goodchild
et al  1993) focus almost entirely on planning models in that each model
presented is intended more as a decision support tool than a descriptive or
exploratory tool. The only descriptive modeling work being published recently
involves the classification of satellite imagery. However, the environmental
field has been using GIS for decades, so there is still a great deal of
literature which addresses the modeling issues of concern here.<p>
Carl Steinitz's basic theory of design is very similar to Rowe, Archer and
Asimow (Figure 2). Although much of the work referenced here is from the 1990s,
it refers to ideas that Steinitz has worked with for decades. In fact he says,
"In 1990, after almost 25 years of applying GIS to many projects, I came to the
realization that there was a common structure to this work, and I wrote a short
paper entitled, `A Framework for Theory [applicable to the education of
landscape architects]'."<a href="/rajsingh/www/mcpsketch/footnotes.html#fn6">[6]</a> This common
structure takes the form of "A Framework for <i>Design as a Verb</i>"
(Figure 2), where Steinitz illustrates a six-stage method where  representation
models explain how the landscape should be described, process models explain
how it operates, evaluation models explain whether it is working well or not,
change models explain how it might be altered, impact models explain what
differences these alterations might cause, and decision models help us decide
whether and how to act. His feedback loops (shown with arrows) relate these
models to one another and shows an iterative pattern where each model can
inform others.<p>
Environmental Impact Assessments show how modeling can be abused. It was stated
above that a model must start with a decision to choose certain relevant
characteristics of a real object or system because it is too difficult to try
to model all characteristics. The planning model then ends with a ranking of
possible outcomes. These assessments are being conducted throughout the world
using the exact same modeling procedure, as if the environmental concerns in,
for example, an urban-industrial area like Los Angeles should be ranked the
same as those in a mostly rural area like Vermont (where a large part of the
economy is eco-tourism). The validity of these techniques has become an issue
of general public debate recently as the U.S. Congress has called into question
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's decision-making techniques. So
although the environmental field is very advanced in terms of using GIS as a
modeling and decision-making tool, they have perhaps gone too far in relying on
analysis to make difficult choices which are as much a product of
socio-cultural issues as technical ones. This is not to say that we should not
strive to construct good decision making models. I simply want to emphasize
that the move from a descriptive model to a planning model is a significant
one, and is outside the scope of this work.<p>
The most important descriptive model in the environmental field is presented in
<i>Landscape Ecology</i> (Forman and Godron 1986), where the landscape is
described generally in terms of structure function and change. Structure refers
to the distinct elements that make up the landscape. Function refers to how
structures interact. Change is the alteration of structure and function over
time. It should be noted that all of these elements change with scale, so that
a farm might be a structure at one scale, but at a larger scale, the farm
structure becomes the separate structures farmhouse, dirt road, cropland,
grazing land, hedgerow, etc. Structure can be more generally described as
consisting of patches, which are relatively homogeneous areas, corridors, which
are places along which living things travel,<a href="/rajsingh/www/mcpsketch/footnotes.html#fn7">[7]</a> and a background matrix, which describes the general
landscape characteristics of the place. Edges are created where different
landscape structures meet. For people, a residential neighborhood is a patch,
while a highway is a corridor. At a larger scale, an apartment building could
be a patch, which would then make every sidewalk and road a corridor and every
stoop part of an edge. At a smaller scale for migratory birds, the chain of
wetlands along the Atlantic coast is a corridor.<p>
The patch-edge-corridor theory is similar to Lynch's district-edge-path, and
may not be a coincidence, as Forman mentions Lynch as having "particularly
elucidated structure and change in the urban landscape" (p. 29).

<h4>Urban Design</h4>
The body of literature drawn upon most heavily in this work is that which looks
at the city as a whole and how the built environment influences its ability to
function well. To develop coherent arguments, there must be an understanding of
how buildings, roads, sidewalks, rail lines, topography, etc., integrate to
form a characteristic place. This field of inquiry is at the heart of what
urban design is about, so these concepts are studied in order to be able to
create a geographic information system that can support the continued
exploration of these ideas.<p>
<i>The Image of the City</i> (Lynch, 1960) examines "the apparent clarity or
`legibility' of the cityscape," and argues that, "a distinctive and legible
environment not only offers security but also heightens the potential depth and
intensity of human experience." From this starting point he proceeds to develop
a theory that in order for a city to be legible, certain elements must be
readily identifiable by its inhabitants; these elements are nodes, paths,
districts, edges and landmarks. Nodes are transportation junctions or
concentrations of activity. Paths are channels along which people (in vehicles
or not) customarily travel. Districts are sections of the city that have some
common character. Edges are boundaries between areas. Landmarks are points of
common reference, like the Empire State Building in New York City, the Citgo
sign in Boston, or the Space Needle in Seattle.<p>
Working from this theory, Lynch tells us how a poor city image can be found
(through sketch planning and input from residents) and how it can be corrected.
The resulting `highly legible' cityscape will then be a much more interesting
and satisfying place for people to live and work. In order to define a city's
imageability and later correct it, the designer must be able to find the nodes,
paths, districts, edges and landmarks as they are perceived by the city's
inhabitants. This work show how a geographic information system could begin to
support this process by finding nodes. The use of GIS is important here because
Lynch's method involves field investigation to find nodes, which limits the
area he is able to study to the amount of highly trained human labor he is able
to muster behind the effort. My method focuses on strategic use of digital data
in order to create an algorithm which find nodes and is field-checked in a
small area, but can then be used to find nodes over any area.

<p>
<i>A Pattern Language </i>(Alexander 1977), gives a much better analytic
framework for urban design than Alexander's previous <i>Notes on the Synthesis
of Form</i>, and it has influenced an entire field of inquiry concerned with
`shape grammars.' These shape grammars have been explored mainly within the
discipline of architecture, but the pattern language also deals with the urban
scale. There are 253 `patterns' which descend in scale from the pattern
`Independent Regions,' which describes how human civilization on the planet
should be organized, to the pattern `Things from your Life,' which talks about
what you should hang on the walls of your home.<p>
Alexander believes that a designer may use the framework by deciding which
pattern best fits their task, and then use that pattern and a few patterns
above and below that main one. As an example, if we were involved in economic
development for `blue-collar' workers, we might start with pattern 42,
`Industrial Ribbon.' This pattern would tell us that although industry is
smelly, noisy, dirty, etc., it must be placed in or near neighborhoods so that
people may understand the connection between the things they use in their daily
life and the process of making them. Also as a practical consideration,
proximity is important so that people do not have to drive to work and spend a
great deal of time in travel to and from work. In situations where the industry
requires too much land for their placement in the general urban fabric to be
practical, they should be placed in an industrial ribbon, which would be near
ring roads (pattern 17) and have truck and train access.
<p>
<b>Figure 5: Pattern 42, Industrial Ribbon <a href="/rajsingh/www/mcpsketch/footnotes.html#fn8">[8]</a></b><br>
<img src=/rajsingh/www/mcpsketch/industry.gif>
<p>
In planning this industrial ribbon, it would be important to take into careful
consideration the idea of work communities (pattern 41), old people everywhere
(pattern 40) and housing on hills (pattern 39).  Descending in scale, we must
consider the university as a marketplace (pattern 43), local town halls
(pattern 44) and necklaces of community projects (pattern 45). More patterns
may be considered, with each likely to be less important to the project as they
get farther removed in scale. So this is a comprehensive guide to urban design,
though it's organizing principles are distinct from Lynch's. <p>
<i>The Next American Metropolis</i> (Calthorpe 1993) is an example of the
latest trend in urban design, "the new urbanism," which advocates high-density
walkable towns with a greater mix of land uses than current zoning policies
generally allow, narrow urban streets which allow the street to be used as
public space as well as transportation and buildings that relate to that public
space instead of to parking lots. Calthorpe has expanded the theory to include
a regional design scheme termed "transit-oriented development," (Figure 6) in
which these new urban areas (which are designed to be small towns) are
connected to each other and to a larger metropolis by public transportation. <p>
These high-density, dispersed small towns are supposed to satisfy the American
desire to live in a small town while still having easy access to the city. This
type of development pattern is also intended to be ecologically sustainable by
concentrating human populations in the least environmentally sensitive areas
and encouraging people to use public transportation. As urban planners expand
the scope of their work to regional planning, the need for information
management and analysis strategies becomes even greater.

<h4>GIS in Planning</h4>
Now with an understanding of modeling has developed in respect to urban design,
we may take a critical look at initial, recent attempts at integrating design
and GIS. A number of researchers are now beginning to explore the potential of
computerized information systems for planning with limited success. Their
concepts seem to be so theoretical as to be of little practical use at this
point, or so specific and data-intensive that the cost to set up the system is
prohibitive.<p>
One area of research involves making analytic tools accessible to non-technical
planners and the general public. This requires new kinds of interfaces to the
information system as well as new kinds of information visualization
techniques. Linsey and Raper have experimented with the provision of spatial
analysis functions through a graphical user interface (Linsey and Raper 1993).
The focus here is on allowing a user to create their own analysis by attaching
a graphical front-end to Arc/Info's map display, database query, buffering and
spatial intersection functions. Shiffer focuses more on visualization
techniques than spatial analysis. His work seeks to create tools that allow the
outcomes of complex processes to be better understood by the general public
(Shiffer 1995). One example is that instead of debating the possible
deleterious effects of airplane noise by explaining the decibel levels of
planes, he presents a system that can play back the actual sound an airplane
would make and allows it to be varied depending upon the type of plane and the
observer's distance from the plane.<p>
Dave and Schmitt (1994) have prototyped an information system that is tailored
to the needs of designers, but their definition of urban design in the context
of this project is very architectural. They decide that the traditional GIS
model is inappropriate for urban design needs and instead use computer aided
design (CAD) programs as their base system. This decision reflects their focus
on three-dimensional rendering and visualization as opposed to spatial
analysis. Although it is true that traditional GISs have weak three-dimensional
visualization tools, by using the computer only as a tool to produce pictures
of the urban environment, all analysis must still occur in the mind of the
designer. This paper will argue that Dave and Schmitt's system, while having
focussed applications, ignores the main benefit of using computerized
information systems, which will be to create new analytic techniques that a
person is able to conceptualize but not execute in their mind.<p>
The National Physical Planning Agency of the Netherlands has been taking an
approach to integrating GIS and design similar to the one put forth here
(Schuur 1994), with a critical difference. They are working on using GIS for
understanding the <i>existing</i> state of the physical world and having
designers use thematic maps as base maps to draw on and design <i>potential</i>
states of the physical world. GIS is then employed once again to rank and
evaluate the potential designs. The critical stage where GIS and design is
integrated still involves the intuition and skill of the designer to synthesize
GIS information in their head instead of with the help of the computer, which
is the same problem Alexander discussed in 1964 in his previously mentioned
<i>Notes</i>. Since the designer's contact with the GIS database is still
through printed maps, he or she can only see a certain amount of information at
one time--with the pattern-finding application presented in this work, I
endeavor to enable the designer to take into account more data than can be
plotted coherently on paper.
