<h3>IV. An Application to Urban Redevelopment</h3>
A concept of how an urban design GIS might work to help build a descriptive
model of the city has now been presented. The question of what this means to
the formation of policy and design interventions has not been addressed
intentionally because those questions are beyond the scope of this model. As
mentioned in the literature review of environmental modeling, I feel that too
often models are constructed as decision making tools instead of decision
support tools. The actual decisions must be made by the individual planner or
planning agency, and any attempt by the GIS to guide the final decision is
risky, as it may lead to a narrowing of possible options too early. This
section will look at a current redevelopment proposal for a public housing
project and describe what can be learned about the housing development using
the model that has just been built.<p>

<h4>Redevelopment Objectives</h4>
The objectives of the design guidelines are:<p><ol>
<li>Build a minimum of 535 public housing units within a larger <b>mixed income
community</b>. These units must be built to a high standard of quality and
designed to current standards for family housing.
<li>Reorganize the site to create a typical urban family housing
neighborhood,<b> one which cannot be readily recognized as "public
"housing"</b>, one in which <b>design promotes sustainable safety</b>, and one
which is <b>integrated into the urban fabric</b> surrounding it.
<li>To the largest extent possible, this redevelopment must <b>address edge
conditions</b> around the site which could compromise or threaten the long term
viability of the new community.
<li>Maximize this unique opportunity to <b>coordinate the efforts and resources
of different city departments and non-profit agencies</b> including, but not
limited to the BHA, MMTTF, BRA, Public Facilities Department ("PFD"), Police
Department ("BPD"), Parks and Recreation Department, Community Centers, School
Department, Department of Public Works, Transportation Department, Public
Library, MBTA, the Mission Church, Medical Academic and Scientific Community
Organization ("MASCO"), Wentworth Institute and numerous additional social
service providers.<p></ol>

The design guidelines are presented here by the owner, the Boston Housing
Authority (BHA), to prospective developers. Although they are for a specific
housing project, they reflect the current thinking in how to make public
housing work. Major design issues center around supporting mixed incomes,
making appearance similar to private housing, and encouraging safety through
design (this concept has been put forth by Jane Jacobs as "eyes on the
street"<a href="footnotes.html#fn21">[21]</a>). 

<h4>Site analysis</h4>
<h5>Design objective one</h5>
Here the BHA requests that a large number of public housing units coexist with
market rate units. Since public housing is only made available to very low
income families, this means that people with incomes that allow them to
purchase market rate housing will live next to people who have almost no
income. Incomes are detailed in census data, but the lowest level of
aggregation is the block group, which covers at least a few city blocks. A unit
by unit analysis is therefore not possible with census data. The parcel
database affords a better resolution for analysis, but the only data available
is land use, land value and building value. An analysis can be attempted by
looking at residential building values and finding places where a wide range of
values are near each other (Figure 24), but building value is still a poor
surrogate for income, which is the stated criteria.<p>
Ideally, the urban design GIS could offer the planner insight into creating
mixed communities with the pattern finding application if unit by unit income
data were available. One procedure would be to find neighborhoods in which the
desired range of incomes were present. The planner could also specify what
percentage of the community should fall within certain income sub-ranges. After
places that met the criteria were identified, other household characteristics
could be studied such as rent, education, place of birth, length of occupancy,
building age, parking, distance from public transportation, etc. to further
develop an understanding of the composition of a viable mixed income community.
As mentioned, this analysis can not be performed well given the current level
of detail in census data, but it may be redundant anyway, as the fulfillment of
objective two may be the catalyst for the fulfillment of objective one.

<h5>Design objective two</h5>
The main thrust of this objective is to create a development in which urban
form and demographic characteristics blend into the larger community (the
safety objective will not be addressed here because safety-related information
is not part of the database). Most public housing projects currently follow the
design ideology in fashion during their construction in the 1960s and 1970s.
They are developments consisting of large, tall, unornamented, multi-family
buildings with a great deal of public open space around them. Organic
neighborhoods in Boston are townhouses with back alleys that can be used for
parking or gardens and fa&ccedil;ades that come right up to the sidewalk, with
a small zone for a stoop and landscaping. Units face streets, which are used by
the general public. The streets are narrow, which slows down vehicular traffic
and makes the street safer for pedestrians. Most residential buildings are
three to four stories tall with none being higher than four and one half
stories.<p>
Understanding the difference in urban form is straightforward. Simple visual
observation shows a marked difference in building form in plan (Figure 25) and
in perspective (Figure 26) between public housing developments and
neighborhoods that have formed organically. The planned developments are the
antithesis of the organic ones. Residences rarely face the street and public
areas relate to the entire development instead of to any one residence. There
are few streets in the developments (Figure 27), so no one passes through
except people connected to them. South of Mission Main, organic development
takes a less dense form as we move away from the city center. There are many
neighborhoods of single family homes of one and two stories along with
triple-deckers.<p>
Although visual analysis works well here to identify the difference in urban
form, an urban design GIS should be able to quantify and operationalize this
difference so that the designer gains a another understanding of the difference
and so that their methods can be applied over larger areas. The difference in
building form might be quantified using an area to perimeter ratio (area /
perimeter). The mean of this ratio is twenty-eight for the group of
institutional buildings to the northwest of Mission Main, nine for the
residential area to the southwest of the development and twelve for the
development itself. At first glance, this seems to suggest that a lower
building to area ratio would better match the neighborhood, but once again,
scale, resolution and the richness of the data set are important because a
townhouse can have the same general shape as a public housing tenement, with
the major differences being in the architectural detail, building quality,
upkeep, number of units and location.<p>
Contrasting the relationship of streets is more straightforward. The public
housing developments rarely have streets in them, and when they do, these
streets often dead end in the development. Organic neighborhoods contain more
streets and they usually culminate in intersections instead of dead ends.<p>
Small nodes seem to be another characteristic of organic neighborhoods, like
the BCA node in the South End, but they are absent from the immediate Mission
Main area. Two minor nodes can be found south and west of the development, but
these are associated with other neighborhoods (Figure 27). If the "home zone"
of Mission Main residents could be expanded to include this area, this might
not be a concern, but as it is, residents only seem to consider the development
as familiar territory.<a href="footnotes.html#fn22">[22]</a><p>
So three conditions have been identified whose spatial characteristics differ
markedly in planned neighborhoods versus organic ones, building form, streets
and nodes. Many others probably exist and each designer should be able to use
the GIS to develop and quantify their own individual ideas.

<h5>Design objective three</h5>
Objective three addresses edge conditions. This will be a difficult task as
land use data shows that the development is bordered mostly by non-residential
uses, except to the south (Figure 28). The development is surrounded by
colleges, hospitals, and their associated parking lots. This makes it hard to
create a neighborhood environment as there are few existing neighborhoods with
which to integrate. Street data shows that the site is also cut off from
neighborhoods to the east by a wide transportation corridor. <p>
A designer might begin to look at solving this "wicked" design problem<a
href="footnotes.html#fn23">[23]</a> with the tools and methodology developed
earlier. Nodes address the problem of the edge between residential and more
public areas well, so here is one way in which the edge condition might be
addressed. For argument's sake, we begin with the assumption that the designer
feels that it is important to create a node in the Mission Main neighborhood.
There are presently no nodes in the area because land uses are largely limited
to institutional buildings, their associated parking lots and public housing.
The designer might explore the possibility  of creating a node by inserting
commercial, recreational and mixed uses in certain areas of the neighborhood,
most likely addressing the edge condition by placing these uses on the northern
and western edges of Mission Main (commercial establishments could attract the
business of workers in the institutional areas). <p>
By doing this in the GIS and running the node algorithm, a relatively objective
judgment regarding the likely success of the design intervention can be
generated. With these new land uses in place, the planner can say that given
the development of certain areas in the manner described, a certain size node
will be created. Other nodes of this size look like place X, place Y and place
Z. There are a lot of assumptions in this scenario. Most significantly, the
node finding algorithm must be accurate and nodes of certain sizes must be
comparable, but at least a design methodology has been created which can be
challenged, debated and refined, instead of a design proposal which seems to
coalesce in the mind of the designer.

<h5>Design objective four</h5>
Objective four is to coordinate the activities of all government and private
agencies that are working with Mission Main. I included the list of the
agencies who would need to be involved to illustrate what a difficult task this
would be. In order to accomplish this goal using traditional techniques,
meetings would be needed with all of these agencies on a periodic basis. In
practice, the coordination of activities is a rare event. This would probably
require a great portion of someone from each agency's time every month, and
then this person would still have to disseminate the information to the rest of
the agency. The knowledge sharing functionality described in the previous
section (III. Functional Prototype: Information Sharing) is perfectly suited to
address this issue. This functionality was described as it would apply to the
situation of a planner organizing input from the general public, but as
agencies are only a subset of the general public, the theory is still the
same.<p>
The benefits of using GIS to address this objective are numerous. Everyone in
each agency would have immediate access to everyone else's latest updates to
the database, the need for time and effort-consuming face-to-face meetings
would be reduced, and all the information would be accessible on any desktop
with a computer and a network connection. In addition to these efficiency
issues, sharing information in this way allows the designer to integrate
everyone's information into analyses of the kinds described above. Using this
system, more information is likely to be considered as part of the project, and
the actions of agencies is more likely to coordinated.<p>

<h4>Policy and design implications</h4>
In order to complete the picture of how these tools might be used, here are a
few insights that the above study would support. This cursory site analysis
leads to a few definite recommendations. First of all, in order to attract a
mixed income clientele, Mission Main buildings should look similar to
townhouses in the downtown area. It was mentioned that there is also a
precedent for a less dense pattern of single family homes and triple-deckers.
Although the argument could be made that the site is outside of the downtown
area and therefore more similar to less urban parts of Boston, following this
example would make it difficult to accommodate the required number of units on
the site.<p>
It will be difficult to integrate the development into the larger community
because the site is largely isolated from other residential neighborhoods. Any
efforts in this area should focus on connecting Mission Main to areas south of
the development, the only direction which offers an opportunity for connection
to a larger neighborhood. As the non-residential areas surrounding the
development consist of major institutions (hospitals and colleges), there is
little that can be done towards addressing edge conditions by changing the
physical form of these places. It would make more sense to emphasize that edge
and focus energy on connecting the development to southern and western
neighborhood areas.<p>
