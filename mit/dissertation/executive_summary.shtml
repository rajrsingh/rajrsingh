<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dissertation investigates the possibility of building a &#8220;web&#8221; 
  of spatial data and geoprocessing services to support distributed and collaborative 
  urban planning analytics. The focal point of this work is research in two areas: 
  the systems needed for Web-based geoprocessing services, and the formal language 
  that must be written to facilitate collaborative processing of analytic models 
  between computers. To be successful, the systems under study require a new information 
  infrastructure framework to be in place. This framework is the subject of other 
  research efforts, which are detailed and discussed in relationship to this work.</p> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This work takes as a starting point the leading research 
  on Web services software paradigms such as XML, SOAP and WSDL<a href="#ref1">*</a> 
  vocabularies, and the newly emerging work on connecting the Web services 
  of disparate organizations (via languages that describe the formal interactions 
  that must take place between systems to conduct transactions<a href="#ref2">&#8224;</a>). 
  This research is mainly geared towards enabling new forms of vertical integration 
  and electronic commerce. While groups like the OpenGIS Consortium have taken 
  a leading role in catalyzing research into geospatial Web services, the specific 
  implications and appropriateness for urban planning have yet to be investigated.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the goal of this project is to build models that can be shared and re-used, 
  there is a great deal of supporting infrastructure that must be in place in 
  order to enable Web-based modeling. This is best explained by way of example. 
  Say that County A has a development suitability model that is working well. 
  County B wants to use the model for its building permitting process, and the 
  state wants to use the model as one input into a regional 
  growth model. A key aspect of development suitability models involves finding 
  soils that can support houses and avoiding terrain that is too steep for building. 
  County B can get the model from County A, but if County B calls their soils 
  by different names than County A, the model will not run. Furthermore, the state 
  may be able to get the model and gather soils data from all the counties, but 
  they all must use the same naming scheme for their soils for the analysis to 
  get anywhere. This issue becomes even more acute when the state tries to deal 
  with data collected on a local level, such as zoning. Currently it is not common 
  for towns to have the same zoning classifications, much less use the same codes 
  to describe the zones. The creation of a unified data schema for land records 
  is required solve this problem. Work in this area is underway and can be leveraged 
  in this project.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem is keeping the data up to date. One of the largest costs in 
  typical modeling work is getting data into the system. If the data import process 
  must occur every time the data changes, the system is far less useful that it 
  otherwise could be. The obvious solution is to access the data over a network 
  from the place of creation, but that is a simplistic, technical response that 
  doesn&#8217;t take into account the diversity of technical sophistication in 
  government, and levels of trust that must be in place for organizations to share 
  their data over a network, and just as importantly, for analysts to rely on 
  the data to be available when needed. A significant part of this research is 
  to classify governmental institutions based on their spatial data needs and 
  technical sophistication, enabling us to specify software systems that can be 
  successfully implemented. It is important to note that there is a large role 
  in the framework proposed here for the private sector. While this research is 
  not a business case for commercial data providers, some attention is paid to 
  pairing roles with the institution motivated to fulfill the role reliably and 
  well. </p>
