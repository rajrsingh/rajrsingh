<p>Urban planning is inherently a multi-disciplinary pursuit. There is no one
person or agency that can do it well. In order to steward our natural
resources, economic future, and quality of life we draw upon the
expertise of many fields. This has its advantages, but it makes the
synthesis of analyses difficult, and leaves little ability for
decision-makers to try out different scenarios or change the underlying
assumptions to account for new information. </p>

<p>This research presents a framework for a new paradigm of modeling and
information infrastructure based on new and emerging Internet
technologies. The system achieves four goals:<br>

<ul>

  <li>Analytic models are made more visible and changeable.</li>
  <li>Models from different groups can interact and be the basis of more holistic research.</li>
  <li>System creation and maintenance are less costly than is now the norm.</li>
  <li>Less well-funded and sophisticated organizations, such as small
towns and community organizations, are able to participate in the
system.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Particular attention is paid to how the quality and quantity of
analysis can increase exponentially in this environment, and how the
nature and use of analyses will evolve.&nbsp; A prototype system is
designed and built around the process of zoning and master planning
that all municipalities go through on an ongoing basis.</p>
